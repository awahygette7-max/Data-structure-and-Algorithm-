📘 Stacks and Queues – Practical Examples from Rwanda

This project introduces the core concepts of Stacks (LIFO) and Queues (FIFO) using real-life Rwandan scenarios like UR student routines, Irembo processes, Nyabugogo bus station, and Airtel customer service. It includes:

✅ Topics Covered:

Stacks: Push, Pop, Top

Queues: Enqueue, Dequeue, Front

Challenges: Logic exercises

Reflections: Why each structure fits real-world uses

📍 Practical Examples:

UR student study steps as stack

Irembo application flow

Nyabugogo bus departure as queue

Airtel customer line behavior

Stadium entry fairness (queue vs stack)

🧠 Learning Goals:

Understand how LIFO and FIFO work

Connect data structures to everyday systems

Practice with relatable, challenge-based questions
