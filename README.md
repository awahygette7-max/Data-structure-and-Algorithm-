 # Insurance Claims Processing

This Python script processes insurance claims data and performs basic operations such as calculating totals, averages, and sorting. It uses different data structures like lists, arrays, and dictionaries.

## What the Script Does

1. **Integer List Operations**: Calculates total, average, maximum, and minimum claim amounts.
2. **String Operations**: Finds the total number of claims and calculates the average claim amount.
3. **Boolean Logic**: Compares each claim to a threshold (100) and prints whether each claim is above or below the standard.
4. **List Operations**: Adds new claims, removes claims over a certain value, and sorts the list.
5. **Array Operations**: Compares the sum of a list and an array of claims.
6. **Dictionary Operations**: Stores claims as dictionaries, updates claims, removes claims, and calculates the total and average values of claims.
